# noise-tracking
Fast nonstationary noise tracking algorithm by Q. Zhang et al. - coded in Python. The implemented algorithm is described in the paper:

Qiquan Zhang, Mingijang Wang, Yun Lu, Muhammad Idrees, Lu Zhang, "Fast Nonstationary Noise Tracking Based on Log-Spectral Power, MMSE Estimator and Temporal Recursive Averaging," IEEE Access, vol. 7., pp. 80985-80999, 2019

# Testing and usage example
To test the noise tracking procedures run the script `noise-tracking.py` from the root folder of the repository. This script also provides a usage example. The testing is based on synthetic data, not related to any real speech and noise signals.
